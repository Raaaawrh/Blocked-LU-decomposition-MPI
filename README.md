# Blocked-LU-decomposition-MPI
Repository contains source code of blocked LU decomposition with MPI parallelization.
Program created with academic purposes at Department of Computational Physics of Saint-Petersburg State University.

I used approach, described here https://github.com/suyashbakshi/LU-Decomposition-Blocked, and made it in OOP-style. Also thanks suyashbakshi a lot. Feel free to copy, use and modify.
Hope this code will help you :)
